### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

I choose the web App services beacuse it is quick, easier and fast to deploy web application. create, developing and deploying the application on a VM seemed very timeconsuming with complex configurations and automation to scale up high. 
Deploying the application connecting to teh Git Hub repository with a CICD workflow was so simeple and easy like click and go which seemed way simple and easier with the web applciation. Whereas the VM deployment can become costly and complex requireing complex configurations. An another reason for me to choose the web application is the availabity and the reliability of the applications. 
The cost of the web application to start migh be higher than VM but as maintainece kicks in the cost grows as per the complexities. The manatanience of the web app is very low and less complex than the Virtual application hence I have choosen web application than Virtual Machine. 

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
